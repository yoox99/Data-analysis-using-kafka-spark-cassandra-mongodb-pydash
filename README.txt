## Introduction

In a world where data is considered the new gold, organizations must process and analyze data in real-time to make informed decisions. This project is designed for data professionals looking to acquire practical skills in implementing real-time data pipelines to extract, transform, and analyze data efficiently. The pipeline consists of several stages, including data extraction from Kafka, data transformation, data storage in Cassandra and MongoDB, data aggregation, debugging, monitoring, and data visualization using Python Dash.

## GDPR Compliance

Ensuring GDPR compliance is crucial when working with data from external sources. GDPR, or the General Data Protection Regulation, mandates that any processing of personal data must adhere to strict data protection principles, including transparency, data minimization, and security. To comply with GDPR, obtain explicit consent from users whose data is being collected, pseudonymize or anonymize the data, encrypt sensitive information, and maintain a comprehensive record of data processing activities. Implement access controls, audit trails, and Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) to ensure GDPR compliance. Furthermore, set up mechanisms to manage data retention and deletion, respecting individuals' right to be forgotten.

## Requirements

To build and run this data pipeline, you need to meet several requirements:

- **Spark and PySpark**: Ensure that Spark and PySpark are properly installed and configured.

- **Kafka, Cassandra, MongoDB**: Install and configure Kafka, Cassandra, and MongoDB. You can use Docker images for these services.

- **JAR Dependencies**: Download the required JAR files and place them in the specified directory (e.g., D://spark_dependency_jars).

- **PyMongo**: Install the PyMongo library to interact with MongoDB.

- **PySpark Kafka Integration**: Ensure that you have the necessary libraries for Spark-Kafka integration.

- **Python Libraries**: Install other required Python libraries using pip or conda.

- **Docker**: If necessary, install and set up Docker for managing dependencies.

## Getting Started

Before diving into the project, make sure you have all the required components set up and configured. You can follow these steps:

### Installation

- Install and configure Spark, PySpark, Kafka, Cassandra, MongoDB, and any other dependencies as needed.

- Place the required JAR files in the specified directory (e.g., D://spark_dependency_jars).

- Install PyMongo and other Python libraries using pip or conda.

### Usage

1. Use the provided code to read data from the Kafka topic "user_profiles".

2. Implement data transformations, including parsing, validation, and data enrichment.

3. Store the transformed user data in Cassandra using the `save_to_cassandra_table` function.

4. Perform data aggregation to derive insights, such as the number of users by nationality and average user age. Store the results in MongoDB using the `save_to_mongodb_collection` function.

5. Set up debugging and monitoring to track the pipeline's performance and catch errors.

6. Create data visualization dashboards using Python Dash to visualize aggregated data.

## Debugging and Monitoring

- Monitor the pipeline's progress and log messages for errors using the Python `logging` library and try-except blocks.

- Verify that data is correctly written to the Cassandra table and MongoDB collections.

## Data Visualization

- Create data visualization dashboards using Python Dash to visualize aggregated data, such as the number of users by nationality and average user age.

## Data Privacy Procedures

- Identify and document personal data using data analysis tools.

- Establish procedures for sorting and deleting unnecessary or outdated personal data in compliance with GDPR regulations.
